// write UnionFind class algorithm in javascript
// The unionâ€“find algorithm is an algorithm that performs two useful operations on a set of elements partitioned into a number of disjoint (non-overlapping) subsets:
//     Find: Determine which subset a particular element is in. This can be used for determining if two elements are in the same subset.
//     Union: Join two subsets into a single subset.
// The unionâ€“find algorithm is also known as the disjoint-set data structure. It provides near-constant-time operations (bounded by the inverse Ackermann function) when used naively, and can be optimised to achieve nearly linear time.
// The algorithm is useful for finding connected components in a graph, where the graph is represented using an edge list or an adjacency matrix. It is also useful for determining the connectivity of a network, where the network is represented using an adjacency matrix.
// The algorithm is described by Cormen et al. in their book Introduction to Algorithms. The algorithm is also described in Sedgewick's book Algorithms in C, Part 5: Graph Algorithms.

[]: # Description: Graph algorithms are algorithms that operate on graphs. Graphs are mathematical structures used to model pairwise relations between objects. A graph in this context is made up of vertices (also called nodes or points), which are connected by edges (also called links or lines). A single edge may connect two vertices, but no vertex is connected to itself. A graph may be directed or undirected. In a directed graph, edges are not bidirectional; in an undirected graph, edges are bidirectional. A graph may also be weighted, where the value of each edge is a real number. Graphs are one of the most common models for representing data in computer science. Graph algorithms are used in a wide variety of applications, including social networks, circuit design, and data compression.

Path Finding Algorithm 
 Input : Graph, source vertex and destination vertex
    Output : Shortest path between source and destination vertex
    1. Create a set sptSet (shortest path tree set) that keeps track of vertices included in shortest path tree, i.e., whose minimum distance from source is calculated and finalized. Initially, this set is empty.
    2. Assign a distance value to all vertices in the input graph. Initialize all distance values as INFINITE. Assign distance value as 0 for the source vertex so that it is picked first.
    3. While sptSet doesnâ€™t include all vertices
        a) Pick a vertex u which is not there in sptSet and has minimum distance value.
        b) Include u to sptSet.
        c) Update distance value of all adjacent vertices of u. To update the distance values, iterate through all adjacent vertices. For every adjacent vertex v, if sum of distance value of u (from source) and weight of edge u-v, is less than the distance value of v, then update the distance value of v.

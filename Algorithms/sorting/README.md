## Sorting Algorithms

# Description

Sorting is a very classic problem of reordering items (that can be compared, e.g., integers, floating-point numbers, strings, etc) of an array (or a list) in a certain order (increasing, non-decreasing (increasing or flat), decreasing, non-increasing (decreasing or flat), lexicographical, etc).

There are many different sorting algorithms, each has its own advantages and limitations.
Sorting is commonly used as the introductory problem in various Computer Science classes to showcase a range of algorithmic ideas.

Without loss of generality, we assume that we will sort only Integers, not necessarily distinct, in non-decreasing order in this visualization

# Types of Sorting Algorithms

## Sorting Algorithms: 
        1. Bubble Sort
            ‚ùì: Array == AlmostSorted && Array < Small Size
            ‚è∞: O(n^2) ü™ê O(1)
            üé≠ PsuendoCode:
                for i = 0 to n-1
                    for j = 0 to n-1
                        if arr[j] > arr[j+1]
                            swap(arr[j], arr[j+1])
        2. Selection Sort
            ‚ùì: Array != Sorted && Array < Small Size
            ‚è∞: O(n^2) ü™ê: O(1)
            üé≠ PsuendoCode:
                for i = 0 to n-1
                    min = i
                    for j = i+1 to n-1
                        if arr[j] < arr[min]
                            min = j
                    swap(arr[i], arr[min])
        3. Insertion Sort

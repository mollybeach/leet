## Array Algorithms

# Description

An array is a data structure consisting of a collection of elements (values or variables), each identified by at least one array index or key. An array is stored such that the position of each element can be computed from its index tuple by a mathematical formula. The simplest type of data structure is a linear array, also called one-dimensional array.

# Types of Arrays

1. Static Array
2. Dynamic Array

# Array Operations

1. Insertion
2. Deletion
3. Traversal
4. Searching
5. Sorting

# Time Complexity

1. Insertion - O(n)
2. Deletion - O(n)
3. Traversal - O(n)
4. Searching - O(n)
5. Sorting - O(nlogn)
